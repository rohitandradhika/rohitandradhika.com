            <p>Radhika's dad, the youngest of his siblings, and the first person Radhika ever saw in her life. He is the reason behind Radhika's calm, patient, and logical nature. He is also the reason for her 'unique' sense of humour, big sweet tooth, and super organization tendencies! Most importantly, he never fails to make Radhika smile! From changing her diapers all the time to giving her away next year at her wedding, Radhika's dad is a huge part of her life. She knows that she can count on him anytime she needs to, and he will never really realize how much his daughter truly loves him! </p>

            <p>Radhika's mom is one of the most caring individuals she knows. It is thanks to her that Radhika has learnt to deal with a variety of personalities around her, and why Radhika tends to nurture people and go out of her way for others. Radhika's mom is also the reason for Radhika's tendencies to be very emotional, speak her mind, and be stubborn in her own ways! She is someone Radhika really cherishes in her heart. She has played such an important role in her life and continues to do so on a daily basis. Although Radhika may not say it all the time, she loves her very deeply!</p>

            <p>Radhika's younger brother, the one she can share absolutely everything with, even things others may judge her for. Without Rohan, Radhika wonders how her life would have been. He has made her such a strong person, and even while being younger than her, his intelligence, creativity, and maturity continues to amaze her! It's his jokes and personality that get her going through the day. He's probably the only one that really understands Radhika's jokes, and has such a strong bond with Radhika that she always understands him. He is one of the most important people in her life.  To say that Radhika feels she is close to her brother is an understatement, she loves him beyond measure!</p>

            <p>Rohit's dad is one the people in Rohit's life that he really looks up to. One of the things Rohit greatly appreciates, is all the time his dad took to put him into sports, which definitely developed his love for sports and the outdoors. Speaking of time, punctuality is one of the main things he is known for, and he for sure has passed that trait down to his son! Same goes for sense of humour, although Rohit's dad leans more towards 'Santa Banta' jokes, he is known for keeping the entertaining conversations going! He is the type of person to always be there for anyone, and will drop whatever he is doing for others. Rohit is truly proud to call him his dad!</p>

            <p>Rohit's mom, coming from a big family, plays a big part in Rohit's life. Since day one, Rohit was always attached to his mom by the hip, and although he may not act as he used to, in his heart he is still a 'momma's boy'! He loves all the time they spend together - from buying hockey cards when younger, to just running errands and shopping. Every moment spent together is a precious moment. She is the reason for his giving nature and big heart! He has definitely learnt a lot from his mom. Although he may not show it openly, he loves and cares for his mom a lot!</p>

He is playful, talkative, loving, and completely harmless.</p>
