<h3 id="c-party-title" class="c-title"><span>Wedding Party</span></h3>
<div id="c-party-container" class="c-container">
<div class="c-intro"><p>Our wedding party consists of our lovely bridesmaids and groomsmen. The bridesmaids are Radhika's cousins and best friend, and the groomsmen are Rohit's cousins and a secret groomsman. These individuals are very close to us and we would love to include them even further in our wedding. </p>
<p>Although Radhika's brothers and Rohit's sisters aren't included in the wedding party formally, in our hearts they are as much a part of this wedding as the individuals listed below!</p></div>  <div class="c-odd">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Manisha Fernando</h4>
            <h5>Maid of Honour</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Manisha_1.JPG" alt="Manisha Fernando" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Manisha has been Radhika's best friend for the past 10 years. Their relationship is one where even separated and unable to meet all the time, they are the closest friends you will ever see! They have been there for each other through thick and thin. They can say anything to each other and not have to worry about it hurting the other. Radhika truly loves Manisha like a sister, and can't even think about having her wedding without Manisha as her maid of honour. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-even">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Shona Sinha</h4>
            <h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/ShonaDidi_3.jpg" alt="Shona Sinha" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Shona is one of Radhika's older cousins who everyone in the family knows can be counted on for anything! She is one of the sweetest, most caring individuals Radhika knows and has a tendency to nurture everyone around her. She also gives great advice! She is beautiful inside and out. Although they barely get to see each other since they live so far apart, she is considered very close to Radhika in her heart. She plays a very essential role in this wedding! </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-odd">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Pema Ram</h4>
            <h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/PemaDidi_3.jpg" alt="Pema Ram" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Pema is another one of Radhika's older cousins and is the type of person to always be there for you no matter what. She is super helpful, fun, loving and just takes care of you like an older sister would :)! It also doesn't hurt that she's so creative, all rounded, and a great entrepreneur! She is definitely required in the wedding party since she is considered close to Radhika no matter the distance.  </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-even">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Shalini Malhotra</h4>
            <h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Shalini_3.jpg" alt="Shalini Malhotra" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Shalini is practically another cousin for Radhika. They have known each other since the time Radhika moved to Canada (17 years now!!), and Radhika admires the person Shalini has become! She is such a fun person to be with and very loving too. She is the type of person you can just relax and be yourself with. These two click so well together and Radhika really hopes that even though Shalini has moved so far away, she can make it back to visit for her wedding!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-odd">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Neha Narula</h4>
            <h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Neha_5.jpg" alt="Neha Narula" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Neha is one of Radhika's closest cousins. She knows Radhika so well and knows how to handle her wild side. Neha definitely makes the child in Radhika come out because she knows she can depend on her older sister (by almost 2 years!) anytime she needs to. Although they didn't know each other as well earlier, time is no factor in this relationship...they just bond so well! This fashionable sister of Radhika's is way too important to not include in the wedding party.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="c-even">
        <div class="c-subtitle">
            <h4>Ria Kharabanda</h4>

        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Ria_4.jpg" alt="Ria Kharabanda" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Ria is Radhika's youngest cousin, but doesn't seem like it at all! Ria is incredibly caring, helpful, and mature for her age. Although she seems quiet and shy at first, once she warms up to you she surprises you with her intelligence and thoughtfulness. She is such a sweet girl and Radhika admires the woman she is becoming. Radhika knows that she can depend on her little sister anytime and loves her a lot! </p>
        </div>

    <div class="c-odd">

        </div>
        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/ChrisBhaiya_10.JPG" alt="Christopher Datta" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Chris is the oldest in the family from Rohit's mom's side, but still so young in ways. Rohit always remembers him as the brother with all the basketball memorabilia including the hats in his room. He is one of the most unbiased and open minded people Rohit knows, and he loves that about him. Although they weren't able to spend much time together because Rohit moved to India and Chris was exploring the globe (which Rohit is always jealous about!), he knows that he can count on him for anything!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Sachit_5.jpg" alt="Sachit Bakshi" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Sachit (Rohit's cousin) and Rohit met for the first time in summer 2003 and just clicked instantly. Rohit's not sure if it was because of his good looks or Sachit's captivating personality ;)! Since then, they have tried to meet once/twice a year, and each time they met it was as if they weren't ever apart to begin with! Now it saddens Rohit to see that things may be changing since Sachit's move. However, no matter the distance, Sachit is very close to Rohit in his heart and will continue to remain so. He just hopes they can continue to meet often!</p>

        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Sunny_5.jpg" alt="Sunny Mohan" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Sunny is one of the first cousins Rohit met after moving to Toronto in 2001. Rohit finds his fun personality very valuable in the squash court where their competitive nature is at a definite high! However, despite their competitive nature, Sunny has a very calm personality which also comes in handy. After watching Sunny grow into this great person, Rohit can really see him becoming a great entrepreneur in the near future.</p>

        <div class="c-photo">
            <img src="images/Sid_3.jpg" alt="Siddharth Datta" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Sid is Rohit's younger cousin from his mom's side, and the two of them have been a duo since they were kids (like two wild bulls!). They are always trying to outdo each other in different sports and games, and Sid has been a really good sport in realizing and accepting that he will always come second to Rohit ;)! They are both really alike in the way they joke around, and although they super competitive with each other, Rohit considers Sid to be one of his closest cousins!</p>
        </div>

            <img src="images/Whoisit_3.jpg" alt="? (Secret - To be revealed)" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Rohit has known this person for quite some time now, and he's just like a brother to him. He is one of the most creative individuals Rohit knows, and lets his hands do all the talking. Not only does his creativity stand out, but so does his intelligence. He is an all rounded person. Rohit is proud of the person he is, and has a lot of fun with him whenever they are together. He will definitely make Rohit proud to be a part of his life in the coming years... Guess who??</p>

            <img src="images/Sahil_9.JPG" alt="Sahil Datta" />
        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Sahil is one of Rohit's youngest cousins from his mom's side, and he's turning out to be one hell of a guy! Sid and Rohit have set the bar so high for him that most people would give up, but they both know that he will succeed and possibly outdo them! He is such a caring person, but his competitive side is definitely coming up to match Rohit and Sid's. He is a really fun guy to be with, and he completes the trio of jokers.</p>
