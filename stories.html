        <div class="c-text">
            <p>The story of how we met never fails to amaze us, mainly because of all the coincidences involved that led to our meeting. </p>
            <p>It started off with my mom hearing about the Delhi University Alumni on the radio while driving to work, and calling the founder of the Alumni to join (since my dad attended that university while in India). We were then invited to a picnic for members of the alumni, where we made several new friends. One of the people we met had brought a friend with her to just give her company (her family had nothing to do with Delhi University). I got their contact information and we decided to stay in touch. After several meetings, this friend decided to invite me over for Christmas Eve to just relax while my parents were out. She then told me that she will be inviting her cousin Rohit over that evening (which I found very funny because I was bringing my cousin Rohit to her house as well). </p>
            <p>Once we met, we just connected, found each other on trusty Facebook, kept chatting on MSN, and moved over to the more traditional method of communication - the telephone.</p>
            <p>And since the day we met (December 2006), we thankfully haven't gotten tired of each other, and more importantly, have developed such a perfect harmony with each other that after dating for 6 1/2 years, we know there's no option but to get married! </p>

            <h4>The Proposal</h4>

        </div>
        <div class="c-text">
            <p>Rohit's proposal for me was absolutely perfect. The most important element to his proposal for both of us was the element of surprise! Since we had already discussed getting married in the summer of 2014, I figured he would propose this summer, I was just afraid that being as intuitive as I am, I would know the day he was going to do it! Rohit was also concerned about me figuring it out, but at the same time he wanted to keep it unique, simple, and private.</p>
            <p>It was June 29th 2013, the day was beautiful, and Rohit and I were ready to go to a friend's house for dinner. On our way there, we went shopping to get their twins some gifts as well as wine for the couple. Once we were done and in the LCBO parking lot, Rohit told me he bought a Kinder surprise because was curious to see what was in the ones specifically for little girls. I told him that maybe we should give it to the friend we're meeting, or at least open it with them, and to that he replied that he hadn't eaten all day so might as well get some chocolate in him! On a side note, Rohit has always liked Kinder surprises and I've gotten them for him on several of our anniversaries as a cute gift. So Rohit asked me to open the Kinder surprise, and pretended to be on his phone checking an email. Once I gave him the chocolate to eat and opened the toy container, I saw a ring. Now I was expecting a toy for a little girl in this Kinder surprise, so I was about to say "Aww, that's so cute!" to Rohit, but then taking a closer look at the ring, I realized that it looked quite real. Then once I saw Rohit's expression, I knew that this was the moment! However, my reaction was not the best, I was just...shocked! So Rohit smiled, recited a short but sweet poem, and asked me to marry him. It was such an incredibly sweet moment...and I of course had to tease him and say "Umm...I don't know...let me think. Kidding! Of course yes!!".</p>
            <p>After that, we couldn't stop talking about the whole thought process and steps involved in his proposal. He said that he never got me a Kinder surprise, and what better time to get one than on the day he proposes? Later, even while discussing all of this and seeing the ring on my finger, I was so shocked and it took a long time for it to hit me that we were actually finally engaged!</p>
